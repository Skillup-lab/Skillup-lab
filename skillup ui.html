# 🌍 The Story of Skill Up – UI/UX Design Vision

---

## 🧩 OVERVIEW

Skill Up is now *the* go-to platform for everyday people to teach and learn locally or online. It’s as easy to use as WhatsApp and as powerful as Google Search — but for learning. Students discover real teachers near them or online, while teachers run their own mini-schools from their phone.

Let’s break down what the **App** and **Website** do, from the moment a new user joins — step by step.
