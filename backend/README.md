# Setup database and create admin user
npm run setup:production

# Start production server
npm start
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

Create your production environment file:

```env
# Server Configuration
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development

# Database Configuration (PlanetScale)
DATABASE_URL=mysql://username:password@host.planetscale.com/database_name?sslaccept=strict
DB_HOST=host.planetscale.com
DB_USER=username
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_NAME=database_name
DB_PORT=3306

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here-make-it-long-and-random
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your-super-secret-refresh-key-here-make-it-long-and-random
JWT_EXPIRE=1h
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRE=7d

# Rate Limiting
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100

# CORS Configuration
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:5173

# Security
BCRYPT_SALT_ROUNDS=12

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

### 3. PlanetScale Database Setup

1. **Create PlanetScale Account**: Sign up at [planetscale.com](https://planetscale.com)
2. **Create Database**: Create a new database in your PlanetScale dashboard
3. **Get Connection String**: Copy the connection string from your database settings
4. **Update Environment**: Add the connection details to your `.env` file

### 4. Database Migration

Run the database migrations to create tables:

```bash
# Create database schema
node database/migrations.js migrate

# Seed with sample data (optional)
node database/migrations.js seed

# Or do both at once
node database/migrations.js migrate:seed
```

### 5. Start the Server

```bash
# Development mode (with nodemon)
npm run dev

# Production mode
npm start
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3000` (or your configured PORT).

```json
{
  "success": true/false,
  "message": "Response message",
  "data": { ... },
  "errors": [ ... ]
}
```

    }
  ]
}
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
